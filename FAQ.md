## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### ❄️ Is it OK that my catalog resets when I refresh the page?
**Yes!** That's exactly what the starter code does too. You don't need to worry about preserving data after a page refresh.

### 💻 Can I copy bits of code from online resources?
**Yes, absolutely!** You should search for and use small chunks of code.  
For example:
- ✅ Copying code to create a dropdown menu is fine.  
- ❌ Copying a full “filter data by date” feature is not.

Be thoughtful about what you borrow!

### 🤖 Can I use generative AI (like ChatGPT or Copilot)?
**Partially.**  
- ✅ You *may* use AI tools to help write **HTML** and **CSS**.  
- ❌ You *may not* use AI to write **JavaScript**.

Why? HTML and CSS can be tricky to get looking nice, so we’re okay with getting help. But JavaScript is where you demonstrate your own understanding of logic and data structures!

### 🧰 Can I use a different template?
**Nope!**  
You must use the provided starter code, though you can change or customize it however you like.  
If you find a different template you love, you *can* copy **small chunks** of code from it, as long as you're not replacing the whole structure.

### 🛠️ Can I use a framework like React, Vue, Bootstrap, or Tailwind?
**Nope!**  
This project is meant for folks new to web development. Frameworks do too much of the work for you.  
SEA (Snap Engineering Academy) will teach you these tools later, so for now stick to **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS**.

---

### 🌐 Can I use APIs?
**Nope!**  
APIs can add complexity that’s beyond the scope of this project.  
If you really want to use external data, save it to a file (like JSON or CSV) and use that file instead.
