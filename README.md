# Project Contraints
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS
    - No packages like npm or yarn
    - No frameworks like React or Bootstrap
    - No supersets of JS like Typescript or JSX
- No API usage
    - If using data from an API, save the data to a file
- Use AI to assist and learn, but not to write for you
    - This also applies to code referenced from online
- Frontend only, data isn't preserved when refreshing page
- Only use template provided
    - I pulled directly from the repos so this shouldn't be an issue

---

# Project Features

- Display a substantial amount of data in a catalog

    - This includes but is not limited to: Filtering, Searching, Sorting, Updating, Add/Remove Entries
